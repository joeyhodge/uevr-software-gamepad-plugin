This plugin will echo gamepad emulation from praydog UEVR injector to software emulated, so steam could pick up gamepad state and overlap with Keyboard/Mouse mapping. 
This Plugin is not intented to remap gamepad mappings it is working out of the box with UEVR injector and steam, however if you need gamepad->keyboard/mouse mapping, this plugin is sole purpose.
P.S. make sure you don't have any real gamepads turned on during session.
